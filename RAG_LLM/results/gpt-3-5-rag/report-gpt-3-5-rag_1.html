the 50 mg Metoprolol Tartrate tablets is 05/05/2014, while the marketing start date for the 100 mg variant is not provided in the given context.","Lopressor should not be used in patients with bronchospastic disease. However, there is an exception where Lopressor may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatments. In such cases, the lowest possible dose of Lopressor should be used, and bronchodilators, including beta-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.","Some central nervous system adverse reactions linked to Lopressor that have been identified during post-marketing include reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia, an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.","The exact dosage strength of the active ingredient found in the light blue capsule form of Lopressor is 100 mg of metoprolol tartrate.","LOPRESSOR should be avoided in patients with worsening cardiac failure, as symptoms may worsen during up-titration of the medication. Additionally, patients with unstable angina should not interrupt therapy without their physician&#x27;s advice, as it may lead to acute coronary ischemia. It is recommended to promptly reinstate LOPRESSOR and take appropriate measures for the management of unstable angina in such cases.","When administering LOPRESSOR to individuals with bronchospastic conditions who have not responded to other antihypertensive treatments, especially if they require the lowest possible dose, it is important to consider the relative beta cardio-selectivity of LOPRESSOR. Additionally, bronchodilators, including beta-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.","The primary active chemical compound found in Lopressor tablets is metoprolol tartrate, and it does not differ between the 50 mg and 100 mg versions.","When starting LOPRESSOR treatment in patients with hepatic impairment, specific precautions should be taken including initiating therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication and increasing doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function. This is necessary because LOPRESSOR is metabolized by the liver, and metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, careful monitoring of the patient&#x27;s liver function and adjustment of the dosage based on hepatic impairment is essential to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.","The details from Validus Pharmaceuticals LLC were most recently updated in September 2023.","The presence of hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol since it is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism. This alteration in metabolism could potentially lead to changes in the levels of metoprolol in the body, affecting its efficacy and potential side effects. Therefore, patients with liver conditions may require close monitoring of their metoprolol dosage and may need adjustments based on their liver function to ensure safe and effective treatment.","The advised starting dose of Lopressor for managing hypertension is 100 mg daily, which can be taken in single or divided doses. The dosage should be adjusted at weekly or longer intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved.","Lopressor tablets should be stored at a temperature of 77\\u00b0F (25\\u00b0C) with excursions permitted to 59\\u00b0 to 86\\u00b0F (15\\u00b0 to 30\\u00b0C). They should be protected from moisture and heat and dispensed in a tight, light-resistant container (USP).","The reported risks of using metoprolol during pregnancy include inconsistent findings of intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality. The methodological limitations of the studies, such as retrospective design, concomitant use of other medications, and other unadjusted confounders, hinder the interpretation of these risks. These limitations may account for the study findings, including the underlying disease in the mother, making it difficult to definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.","According to the animal studies mentioned in the document, long-term studies in rats showed that metoprolol did not impair fertility at oral dosages of up to 800 mg/kg/day. There were no observed effects on spermatogenesis or the development of benign or malignant neoplasms under these conditions.","Patients with peripheral vascular disease who are already diagnosed and prescribed beta-blockers should anticipate the potential aggravation or precipitation of arterial insufficiency symptoms. Additionally, they should be cautious about exacerbation of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and worsening heart failure. They should also be careful about worsening AV block and be closely monitored for progression of arterial obstruction.","In the clinical study involving myocardial infarction patients, Lopressor was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36%. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital. Patients with hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure were ineligible to participate. The timing of administration did not significantly affect the reduction in mortality for those treated early (\\u2264 8 hours) compared to those in whom treatment was started later. Additionally, there were significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and chest pain following initial intravenous administration.","Neonates born to mothers who are receiving metoprolol during pregnancy may be at risk for hypotension, hypoglycemia, bradycardia, and respiratory depression. These conditions should be observed carefully and managed accordingly.","The signs and symptoms of an overdose of LOPRESSOR, such as severe bradycardia, hypotension, or cardiogenic shock, might become more pronounced or severe in patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure who may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability.","LOPRESSOR is prescribed for adult patients with hypertension to reduce blood pressure. The initial dosage is usually 100 mg daily, which can be adjusted until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. The effective dosage range is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied, and larger or more frequent daily doses may be required for some patients. The medication should be taken with or immediately following meals. It is important to monitor blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to ensure satisfactory control throughout the day.","According to clinical pharmacology studies, metoprolol reduces heart rate and cardiac output in patients. The reduction in heart rate and cardiac output is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta-blocking effects in the range of 30-80% correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes at plasma concentrations above 300 nmol/L.","Under normal physiological conditions, the estimated oral bioavailability of immediate release metoprolol is about 50% due to pre-systemic metabolism.","When administering LOPRESSOR to patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, it is necessary to give it in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. This combination is necessary because the administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.","The approximate oral bioavailability of immediate release metoprolol is about 50% due to pre-systemic metabolism, which is saturable. This saturation leads to a non-proportionate increase in exposure with an increased dose.","Some of the adverse reactions related to the central nervous system that have been observed during the post-marketing phase of Lopressor include reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia. This is described as an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.","Some of the more frequently observed adverse reactions to beta-blockers in patients with both hypertension and angina include tiredness, dizziness, depression, mental confusion, short-term memory loss, headache, nightmares, and insomnia affecting the central nervous system.
