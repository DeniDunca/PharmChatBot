It is characterized by behaviors that include one\nor more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm,\nand craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is\ncommon.\nConcerns about abuse and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. However, all\npatients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use\nof opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.\n\"Drug seeking\" behavior is very common in addicts, and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include\nemergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination,\ntesting or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance\nto provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). \"Doctor\nshopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug\nabusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain\nrelief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.\nAbuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians\nshould be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of\nphysical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of mu-opioid agonists can occur in the absence of\ntrue addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other\npsychoactive substances. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity,\nfrequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.\nAbuse of NUCYNTA™ poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent\nabuse of NUCYNTA™ with alcohol and other substances. In addition, parenteral drug abuse is\ncommonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":12,"topic":"NUCYNTA™ Medication"}}

Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher\nblood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger\npatients (see \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n). In a multiple dose pharmacokinetic study\nin elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril\/hydrochlorothiazide\ncombination, the AUC increased approximately 120% for lisinopril and approximately\n80% for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients. Lisinopril can be removed by\nhemodialysis.\nStudies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple\ndoses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues; however, milk of\nlactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of \nC lisinopril. By whole\nbody autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of\nlabeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.\nPharmacodynamics: \nAdministration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine\nand standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory\ntachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can\noccur and should be anticipated in volume and\/or salt-depleted patients (See\nWARNINGS\n).\nIn most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after\noral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood\npressure achieved by six hours.\nIn some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to\nfour weeks of therapy.\nAt recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for\nat least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours, was substantially\nsmaller than the effect six hours after dosing.\nThe antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy.\nAbrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood\npressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.\nIn hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure\nreduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or\nno change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients,\nfollowing administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that\nwas not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the\neffect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal\nfunction, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.\nIn patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated\nand effective in controlling blood pressure (See \nPRECAUTIONS\n).\nHydrochlorothiazide\n \nThe mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.

When administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration for the capsule is approximately 66% the concentration for the tablet.","reference_context":"Document 101: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nTizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces\nspasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine\nare greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to\nreduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption and Distribution\nFollowing oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute\noral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-\npass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with\na mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L\/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous\nadministration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to\nplasma proteins.\nDifferences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets\nTizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting\nconditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two\n4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four\nperiod, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible\nfor the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in\nthe fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after\ndosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were\nadministered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by\napproximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased\nby 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were\nadministered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by\n20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours.\nConsequently, the mean C \nfor the capsule when administered with food is\napproximately 66% the C \nfor the tablet when administered with food.\nFood also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The\nincrease with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%).\nConsequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the\ncapsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the\ncapsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an\nintact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on\napplesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C \nand AUC of tizanidine and a 15\nminute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to\nadministration of an intact capsule while fasting.\nFigure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine\nTablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions\nmax\nmax\nmax","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":101,"topic":"Tizanidine Hydrochloride"}}

In contrast, increasing exposure (AUC) to tapentadol-O-glucuronide was\nobserved with increasing degree of renal impairment. In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal\nimpairment, the AUC of tapentadol-O-glucuronide are 1.5-, 2.5-, and 5.5-fold higher compared with\nnormal renal function, respectively.\nHepatic Impairment\nAdministration of NUCYNTA™ resulted in higher exposures and serum levels to tapentadol in subjects\nwith impaired hepatic function compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The ratio of\ntapentadol pharmacokinetic parameters for the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups in\ncomparison to the normal hepatic function group were 1.7 and 4.2, respectively, for AUC; 1.4 and 2.5,\nrespectively, for C\n; and 1.2 and 1.4, respectively, for t\n.
