In vasospastic angina, amlodipine blocks constriction and restores blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to various stimuli.","reference_context":"Document 72: can be detected \nin vitro\n but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at\ntherapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within\nthe physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic\ninteraction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of\nassociation and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of\neffect.\nAmlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth\nmuscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood\npressure.\nThe precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully\ndelineated, but are thought to include the following:\nExertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, NORVASC reduces the total\nperipheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate\npressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.\nVasospastic Angina: NORVASC has been demonstrated to block constriction and\nrestore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium\nepinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and\nin human coronary vessels \nin vitro\n. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for\nthe effectiveness of NORVASC in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nHemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with\nhypertension, NORVASC produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and\nstanding blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a\nsignificant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.\nAlthough the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood\npressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic\nstable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to\nclinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients\nwith angina.\nWith chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained\nfor at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and\nelderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with NORVASC is also\ncorrelated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate\nhypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response\nthan patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive\nsubjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1\/–2 mmHg).\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of NORVASC\nresulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration\nrate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac\nfunction at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular\nfunction treated with NORVASC have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac\nindex without significant influence on dP\/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure\nor volume.

Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a\nconsistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to dose, selection of proper dosage\nrequires individual titration.\nIn several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by\noral administration of Lopressor caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood\npressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary\nartery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.\n12.3 \n  \nPharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\n: \nThe estimated oral bioavailability of immediate release metoprolol is about\n50% because of pre-systemic metabolism which is saturable leading to non-\nproportionate increase in the exposure with increased dose.\nDistribution:\n Metoprolol is extensively distributed with a reported volume of distribution\nof 3.2 to 5.6 L\/kg. About 10% of metoprolol in plasma is bound to serum albumin.\nMetoprolol is known to cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Metoprolol is also\nknown to cross the blood brain barrier following oral administration and CSF\nconcentrations close to that observed in plasma have been reported. Metoprolol is not a\nsignificant P-glycoprotein substrate.\nElimination:\n \nElimination of Lopressor is mainly by biotransformation in the liver. The\nmean elimination half-life of metoprolol is 3 to 4 hours; in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers the\nhalf-life may be 7 to 9 hours.\nMetabolism:\n Lopressor is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Metoprolol is a racemic\nmixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits\nstereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent\n(poor metabolizers) in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other\npopulations. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma\nconcentrations of Lopressor than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity\nthereby decreasing Lopressor’s cardioselectivity.\nExcretion\nApproximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive\nmetabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose\nare excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40%\nof oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is\nexcreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity.\nThe renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal\nexcretion.\nSpecific populations\nGeriatric patients:\n The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma\nconcentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the\ndrug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is\nnot clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":105,"distracting_context":"12 HOUR NASAL DECONGESTANT- pseudoephedrine hydrochloride tablet, film\ncoated \n \nCARDINAL HEALTH\n----------\nPseudoephedrine hydrochloride\nDrug Facts\nActive ingredient (in each tablet)\nPseudoephedrine HCl, USP 120 mg\nPurpose\nNasal decongestant\nUses\ntemporarily relieves nasal congestion due to the common cold, hay fever or other\nupper respiratory allergies\ntemporarily relieves sinus congestion and pressure\nWarnings\nDo not use\n if you are now taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)\n(certain drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's\ndisease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug.
