specific active ingredients present in the product manufactured by C&amp;BCOSMETIC Co.,Ltd. are:\\n\\n1. NIACINAMIDE: 2 g per 100 mL\\n2. TITANIUM DIOXIDE: 4.694 g per 100 mL\\n3. ADENOSINE: 0.04 g per 100 mL\\n4. OCTINOXATE: 7 g per 100 mL\\n\\nThese ingredients are mentioned in the \\"Drug Facts\\" document, which appears to be a product label or information sheet. The quantities of each ingredient are also specified per 100 mL of the product.","Based on the provided context, lisinopril is primarily eliminated from the body through the kidneys. It is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine.\\n\\nAs stated in the document: \\"Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min.\\"\\n\\nIn other words, the primary route of elimination for lisinopril is the kidneys, and under normal circumstances, its elimination half-life is little changed. However, in cases where renal function is impaired (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min), the decrease in elimination becomes clinically significant.","Based on the provided context and previous question-answer pairs, I can answer your question.\\n\\nThe most common systemic effects observed in toxicological studies with tapentadol were:\\n\\n* Impaired respiratory function\\n* Convulsions (which occurred at plasma levels comparable to the maximum recommended human dose)\\n\\nThese effects were related to the mu-opioid receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition pharmacodynamic properties of tapentadol.","Based on the provided context and previous question-answer pairs, the following are the clinical signs and symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance that patients undergoing thiazide therapy should be monitored for:\\n\\nClinical Signs and Symptoms:\\n\\n1. Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)\\n2. Hypochloremic alkalosis (low chloride levels)\\n3. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)\\n4. Dryness of mouth\\n5. Thirst\\n6. Weakness\\n7. Lethargy\\n8. Drowsiness\\n9. Restlessness\\n10. Confusion\\n11. Seizures\\n12. Muscle pains or cramps\\n13. Muscular fatigue\\n14. Hypotension (low blood pressure)\\n15. Oliguria (reduced urine production)\\n16. Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)\\n17. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting\\n\\nSpecific Conditions that May Exacerbate Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances:\\n\\n1. Severe cirrhosis: Patients with severe cirrhosis may develop hypokalemia, especially with brisk diuresis.\\n2. Prolonged therapy: Hypokalemia may develop after prolonged thiazide therapy, especially if adequate oral electrolyte intake is interfered with.\\n3. Brisk diuresis: Rapid fluid loss through diuresis can lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia.\\n4. Vomiting or parenteral fluids: Patients who are vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids may require more frequent serum and urine electrolyte determinations.\\n\\nIn diabetic patients, dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required due to the potential for hyperglycemia during thiazide therapy.","Based on the provided context and background information, the specific contraindications for the usage of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are:\\n\\n1. Patients who are hypersensitive to this product.\\n2. Patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\\n3. Patients with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.\\n4. Patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\\n5. Combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril). Do not administer Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor.\\n\\nAs for the patient populations where caution should be exercised when prescribing this medication, the following are mentioned:\\n\\n1. Patients on diuretic therapy: Caution is recommended as patients may experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril.\\n2. Elderly patients: Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause hypotension, which may be more severe in elderly patients.\\n3. Black patients: ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in black patients compared to non-black patients.\\n4. Pregnant women: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, and treatment options should be discussed.\\n\\nOverall, caution is recommended when prescribing lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets to ensure safe and effective use in various patient populations.","Based on the provided context, the differences in bioavailability between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets when administered with food are as follows:\\n\\n* Mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax): When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, Cmax was increased by approximately 30%, whereas when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, Cmax was decreased by about 20%.\\n* Median time to peak plasma concentration: Food increased the median time to peak plasma concentration by 25 minutes for tablets and by 2-3 hours for capsules.\\n* Amount absorbed: When each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet.\\n\\nIn summary, when Tizanidine Capsules and Tablets are administered with food, the bioavailability of the tablets is higher than that of the capsules. The Cmax of tablets is increased by 30%, whereas that of capsules is decreased by 20%. Additionally, the median time to peak plasma concentration for tablets is shorter than that for capsules.","Based on the provided context and previous question-answer pairs, the potential adverse reactions that may occur when tizanidine is taken with CYP1A2 inhibitors include:\\n\\n* Hypotension (low blood pressure)\\n* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)\\n* Excessive drowsiness\\n\\nThese adverse reactions can occur due to the inhibition of CYP1A2 enzymes by other medications, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones (except ciprofloxacin), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine.\\n\\nTo minimize the risk of these adverse reactions, precautions that should be taken include:\\n\\n* Avoiding concomitant use of tizanidine with CYP1A2 inhibitors unless clinically necessary\\n* Initiating therapy with a low dose (2 mg) and increasing in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy\\n* Monitoring patients for signs of hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness\\n* Reducing or discontinuing tizanidine therapy if adverse reactions occur\\n\\nAdditionally, the context suggests that concomitant use with oral contraceptives is not recommended, but if necessary, it should be initiated with a single 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy.","Based on the provided context and previous question + answer pairs, I can conclude that the specific effects resulting from the combined use of tizanidine and fluvoxamine are:\\n\\n* Significantly decreased blood pressure\\n* Increased drowsiness\\n* Increased psychomotor impairment\\n\\nThese adverse effects are mentioned in the drug interaction section (7.1) of the prescribing information for Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules, which states: \\"Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment.\\"\\n\\nThe combination of these effects likely contributed to the decision to contraindicate the concomitant administration of tizanidine and fluvoxamine.","Based on the provided documents, I found that there is no information regarding the product with NDC:75990-4019-4.
