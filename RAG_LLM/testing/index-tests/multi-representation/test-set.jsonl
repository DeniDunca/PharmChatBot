Albuterol sulfate is a relatively selective beta \n-\nadrenergic bronchodilator (see \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n).

Albuterol sulfate is a white crystalline powder, soluble in water and\nslightly soluble in ethanol. The World Health Organization recommended name for\nalbuterol is salbutamol.\nAlbuterol sulfate inhalation solution is supplied in two strengths in unit dose vials. Each\nunit dose vial contains either 0.63 mg of albuterol equivalent to 0.75 mg of albuterol\nsulfate or 1.25 mg of albuterol equivalent to 1.5 mg of albuterol sulfate with sodium\nchloride and sulfuric acid in a 3-mL isotonic, sterile, aqueous solution.

For albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, like all other nebulized treatments,\nthe amount delivered to the lungs will depend on patient factors, the jet nebulizer\nutilized, and compressor performance. Using the Pari LC Plus™ nebulizer (with face\nmask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari PRONEB™ compressor, under in vitro\nconditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouth piece (% nominal dose) was\napproximately 43% of albuterol (1.25 mg strength) and 39% of albuterol (0.63 mg\nstrength) at a mean flow rate of 3.6 L\/min.
