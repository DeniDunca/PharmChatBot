For\nthe same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring\ncomplete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.\nNeonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome\nUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression,\nlethargy, hypotonia) and\/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability,\nrestlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see\nPRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy\n).
