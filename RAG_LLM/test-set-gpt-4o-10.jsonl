It is characterized by behaviors that include one\nor more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm,\nand craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is\ncommon.\nConcerns about abuse and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. However, all\npatients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use\nof opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.\n\"Drug seeking\" behavior is very common in addicts, and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include\nemergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination,\ntesting or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance\nto provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). \"Doctor\nshopping\" (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug\nabusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain\nrelief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.\nAbuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians\nshould be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of\nphysical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of mu-opioid agonists can occur in the absence of\ntrue addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other\npsychoactive substances. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity,\nfrequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.\nAbuse of NUCYNTA™ poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent\nabuse of NUCYNTA™ with alcohol and other substances. In addition, parenteral drug abuse is\ncommonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":12,"topic":"Pharmaceutical Labeling"}}

Administration of\nlisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the\npotassium loss associated with the diuretic.\nIn clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of\nlisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The lisinopril and\nhydrochlorothiazide 10 mg\/12.5 mg combination worked equally well in black and white\npatients. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg\/12.5 mg and lisinopril and\nhydrochlorothiazide 20 mg\/25 mg combinations appeared somewhat less effective in\nblack patients, but relatively few black patients were studied. In most patients, the\nantihypertensive effect of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was sustained for at least 24\nhours.\nIn a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of lisinopril\nand hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg\/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg\/25\nmg were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter\ncombination may be controlled with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg\/12.5 mg\n(See \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":31,"topic":"Pharmaceutical Labeling"}}

Available data from\nclinical trials of lisinopril are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not cause\nagranulocytosis at similar rates.

Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull\nhypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected,\ndiscontinue lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse\noutcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third\ntrimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after\nexposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs\naffecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate\nmanagement of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize\noutcomes for both mother and fetus.\nIn the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs\naffecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the\npotential risk to the fetus.

Fetal\ntesting may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy.
