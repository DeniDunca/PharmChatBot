Patients in all three studies had moderate to\nsevere OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown\nObsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.\n•\n•\n•\nAnalyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential\nresponsiveness on the basis of age or sex.\nThe effectiveness of ZOLOFT was studied in the risk reduction of OCD relapse. In Study\nOCD-4, patients ranging in age from 18–79 meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had\nresponded during a 52-week single-blind trial on ZOLOFT 50-200 mg\/day (n=224) were\nrandomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks\nof observation for analysis of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical\nresponse. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the Y-\nBOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved), 2\n(much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Insufficient clinical response during the\ndouble-blind phase indicated a worsening of the patient’s condition that resulted in study\ndiscontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Relapse during the double-blind phase\nwas defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and\n2, and condition 3 being met at visit 3):\nStudy OCD-1 was an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled study with flexible\ndosing of ZOLOFT in a range of 50 to 200 mg\/day, titrated in 50 mg increments\nevery 4 days to a maximally tolerated dose; the mean dose for completers was 186\nmg\/day. Patients receiving ZOLOFT (N=43) experienced a mean reduction of\napproximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically\nsignificantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients\n(N=44). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy\nendpoint) was -3.79 (ZOLOFT) and -1.48 (placebo).\nStudy OCD-2 was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose study,\nincluding ZOLOFT doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg\/day. ZOLOFT (N=240) was\ntitrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days.\nPatients receiving ZOLOFT doses of 50 and 200 mg\/day experienced mean\nreductions of approximately 6 points on the Y-BOCS total score, which were\nstatistically significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-\ntreated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the\nprimary efficacy endpoint) was -5.7 (pooled results from ZOLOFT 50 mg, 100 mg,\nand 150 mg) and -2.85 (placebo).\nStudy OCD-3 was a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled study with flexible\ndosing of ZOLOFT in a range of 50 to 200 mg\/day; the mean dose for completers\nwas 185 mg\/day. ZOLOFT (N=241) was titrated to the assigned dose over two\nweeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving ZOLOFT experienced a\nmean reduction of approximately 7 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was\nstatistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points\nin placebo-treated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to\nlast visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was - 6.5 (ZOLOFT) and -3.6 (placebo).","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What were the results of Study OCD-1 regarding the effectiveness of ZOLOFT in treating OCD?","answer":"Patients receiving ZOLOFT experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients."},{"question":"What were the inclusion criteria for patients in Study OCD-4 regarding the risk reduction of OCD relapse with ZOLOFT?","answer":"Patients ranging in age from 18–79 meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on ZOLOFT 50-200 mg\/day were included."}],"seed_document_id":314,"topic":"Sertraline Medication"}}
