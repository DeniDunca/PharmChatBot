The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug\nrelated were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy\nmacrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-\nmonth study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg\/kg\/day (9\ntimes, on a mg\/m\n basis, the daily dose of 400 mg for a 60-kg patient), benign lung\ntumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest\ndose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total\n(benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant\ntumors.

This\npreferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations,\nmetoprolol also inhibits beta\n-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and\nvascular musculature.\nMetoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is\ndetectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade.\nAnimal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and\ndecreases AV nodal conduction.\nThe relative beta\n-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In\nnormal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta\n-mediated vasodilating effects\nof epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which\ncompletely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients,\nmetoprolol reduces FEV\n and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker,\npropranolol, at equivalent beta\n-receptor blocking doses.\nHypertension:\n The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents\nhas not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed:\n(1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac)\nadrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading\nto reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.\nAngina Pectoris: \nBy blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity\nand extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the\noxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the\nlong-term management of angina pectoris.\nHeart Failure:\n The precise mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in heart\nfailure has not been elucidated.\n12.2 \n  \nPharmacodynamics\nClinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in\nman, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon\nexercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of\nisoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.\nThe relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is\nindependent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta\n-blocking effects in the range of\n30-80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate)\ncorrespond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol\/L. The relative\nbeta\n-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta\n-adrenoceptors\nincreases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol\/L.\nSignificant beta-blocking effect (as measured by reduction of exercise heart rate) occurs\nwithin 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration is dose-related. For example, a\n50% reduction of the maximum effect after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg\noccurred at 3.3, 5.0, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral\ndosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure\nwas evident at 12 hours. When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal\nvolunteers, maximum beta-blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes.\nEquivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":12,"topic":"Others"}}
