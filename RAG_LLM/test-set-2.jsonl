Therefore, patient\nleukapheresis material and PROVENGE may carry the risk of transmitting infectious\ndiseases to health care professionals handling the product. Accordingly, health care\nprofessionals should employ universal precautions when handling leukapheresis material\nor PROVENGE.\n5.5 Concomitant Chemotherapy or Immunosuppressive Therapy\nUse of either chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents (such as systemic\ncorticosteroids) given concurrently with the leukapheresis procedure or PROVENGE has\nnot been studied. PROVENGE is designed to stimulate the immune system, and\nconcurrent use of immune-suppressive agents may alter the efficacy and\/or safety of\nPROVENGE. Therefore, evaluate patients carefully to determine whether it is medically\nappropriate to reduce or discontinue immunosuppressive agents prior to treatment with\nPROVENGE.\n5.6 Product Safety Testing\nPROVENGE is released for infusion based on the microbial and sterility results from\nseveral tests: microbial contamination determination by Gram stain, endotoxin content,\nand in-process sterility with a 2-day incubation to determine absence of microbial\ngrowth. The final (7-day incubation) sterility test results are not available at the time of\ninfusion. If the sterility results become positive for microbial contamination after\nPROVENGE has been approved for infusion, Dendreon will notify the treating physician.\nDendreon will attempt to identify the microorganism, perform antibiotic sensitivity testing\non recovered microorganisms, and communicate the results to the treating physician.\nDendreon may request additional information from the physician in order to determine\nthe source of contamination.\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (≥ 15% of patients\nreceiving PROVENGE) were chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, joint ache, and\nheadache.\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe safety evaluation of PROVENGE is based on 601 prostate cancer patients in the","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":10,"topic":"PROVENGE Treatment"}}

During ex vivo culture with PAP-GM-CSF, APCs take up and process the recombinant target antigen into small peptides that are then displayed on the APC surface.","reference_context":"Document 14: CSF, consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in prostate\ncancer tissue, linked to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an\nimmune cell activator. Each dose of PROVENGE contains a minimum of 50 million\nautologous CD54 \n cells activated with PAP-GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated\nRinger's Injection, USP.\nThe active components of PROVENGE are autologous APCs and PAP-GM-CSF. During\nculture, the recombinant antigen can bind to and be processed by APCs into smaller\nprotein fragments. The recombinant antigen is designed to target APCs, and may help\ndirect the immune response to PAP. Minimal residual levels of the intact PAP-GM-CSF are\ndetectable in the final PROVENGE product.\nThe patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained via a standard\nleukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days prior to the infusion date. Due to the\nautologous nature of PROVENGE, it is important that the patient and physician adhere to\nthe personalized leukapheresis and infusion schedules.\nThe cellular composition of PROVENGE is dependent on the composition of cells\nobtained from the patient's leukapheresis. In addition to APCs, the final product contains\nT cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells. The number of cells present and\nthe cellular composition of each PROVENGE dose will vary.\nThe potency of PROVENGE is in part determined by measuring the increased expression\nof the CD54 molecule, also known as ICAM-1, on the surface of APCs after culture with\nPAP-GM-CSF. CD54 is a cell surface molecule that plays a role in the immunologic\ninteractions between APCs and T cells, and is considered a marker of immune cell\nactivation.\nIn-process and final sterility tests are initiated prior to shipping, but the final results are\nnot available for up to 7 days. PROVENGE is released for shipping based on acceptable\nresults from 2-day incubation of the in-process sterility test.\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nPROVENGE is classified as an autologous cellular immunotherapy. While the precise\nmechanism of action is unknown, PROVENGE is designed to induce an immune\nresponse targeted against PAP, an antigen expressed in most prostate cancers. During\nex vivo culture with PAP-GM-CSF, APCs take up and process the recombinant target\nantigen into small peptides that are then displayed on the APC surface.\nIn Study 1, 237 out of the 512 patients randomized were evaluated for the development\nof humoral and T cell immune responses (proliferative and gamma-interferon (γIFN)\nELISPOT) to the target antigens at Baseline, and at Weeks 6, 14, and 26. Antibody (IgM\nand IgG) responses against PAP-GM-CSF and PAP antigen alone were observed through\nthe follow-up period in the PROVENGE group. Neutralizing antibody responses to GM-\nCSF were transient. T cell proliferative and γIFN ELISPOT responses to PAP-GM-CSF\nfusion protein were observed in cells collected from peripheral blood of patients through\nthe follow-up period in the PROVENGE treatment group but not in controls. In some\npatients a response to PAP antigen alone was observed. No conclusions could be made\nregarding the clinical significance of the observed immune responses.\n+","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":14,"topic":"Others"}}
