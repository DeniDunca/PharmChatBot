Visit a cell collection center for leukapheresis to collect cells for treatment.\\n2. Collected cells are sent to a manufacturing center to be mixed with a protein for infusion preparation.\\n3. Receive PROVENGE in 3 intravenous infusions, approximately 2 weeks apart, with each infusion lasting about 60 minutes.\\n4.

Its intended medical purpose is as a nasal decongestant to temporarily relieve nasal congestion due to the common cold, hay fever, or upper respiratory allergies, reduce swelling of nasal passages to allow for easier breathing, and temporarily relieve sinus congestion and pressure. Individuals with certain health conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, diabetes, or trouble urinating due to an enlarged prostate gland should consult a doctor before using this product.","If a patient experiences acute infusion reactions like chills, fatigue, or fever during the PROVENGE infusion, the specific steps that should be taken include monitoring the patient closely, ensuring that the infusion bag does not exceed room temperature for more than 3 hours, and reporting the symptoms to the healthcare provider promptly. It is important to follow the guidelines provided in the full prescribing information for PROVENGE and seek medical advice if necessary.","Based on the information provided, the active components found in PROVENGE include antigen-presenting cells (APCs), T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells. These components are dependent on the composition of cells obtained from the patient&#x27;s leukapheresis. The potency of PROVENGE is determined in part by measuring the increased expression of the CD54 molecule (also known as ICAM-1) on the surface of APCs after culture with PAP-GM-CSF. PROVENGE is designed to induce an immune response targeted against PAP, an antigen expressed in most prostate cancers. It is important to note that PROVENGE is classified as an autologous cellular immunotherapy and is for autologous use only.","The adverse reactions with an incidence rate of 15% or higher for the drug mentioned are cough and edema.
