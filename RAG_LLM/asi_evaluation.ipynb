ATRIPLA can pass into your breast milk, and there is a risk of passing HIV-1 to your baby. The prescribing information clearly states that breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication. Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\",\"Emtricitabine interferes with the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) through two primary mechanisms:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Competition with the natural substrate**:  \\\\n   Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine. Once phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form **emtricitabine 5&#x27;-triphosphate (FTC-TP)**, it competes with the natural substrate **deoxycytidine 5&#x27;-triphosphate (dCTP)**. By binding to the active site of HIV-1 RT, FTC-TP blocks the incorporation of dCTP, thereby inhibiting the elongation of viral DNA.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Incorporation into nascent viral DNA**:  \\\\n   When FTC-TP is incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain instead of dCTP, it acts as a **chain terminator**. This is because emtricitabine lacks the 3\\\\u2019-hydroxyl group needed for the addition of further nucleotides. As a result, DNA synthesis halts, preventing the completion of the viral genome.\\\\n\\\\n### Key Mutation Leading to Resistance:  \\\\nThe **M184V/I** substitution in HIV-1 RT reduces susceptibility to emtricitabine by diminishing its incorporation efficiency while maintaining viral replication capacity.  \\\\n\\\\nThis dual mechanism (competitive inhibition + chain termination) makes emtricitabine a critical component of HIV-1 combination therapies like **Atripla**.\",\"Yes, there are contraindications for using ATRIPLA in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. According to the document, ATRIPLA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) because it is a fixed-dose combination and cannot be dose-adjusted [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].\"]],[\"reference_answer\",[\"If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, you should not breastfeed because of the risk of passing HIV-1 to your baby while taking ATRIPLA.\",\"Emtricitabine 5&#x27;-triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5&#x27;-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in chain termination.\",\"The active ingredients in ATRIPLA are efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.\"]],[\"id\",[167,124,176]],[\"content\",[\"ATRIPLA during pregnancy.
