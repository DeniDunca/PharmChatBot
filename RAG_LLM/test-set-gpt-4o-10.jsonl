The structural formula is:\nThe molecular weight of tapentadol HCl is 257.80, and the molecular formula is C\nH\nNO·HCl. The\nn-octanol:water partition coefficient log P value is 2.87. The pKa values are 9.34 and 10.45.

Although its exact mechanism is unknown,\nanalgesic efficacy is thought to be due to mu-opioid agonist activity and the inhibition of\nnorepinephrine reuptake.\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nTapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. It is 18 times less potent than morphine in binding to\nthe human mu-opioid receptor and is 2–3 times less potent in producing analgesia in animal models.\nTapentadol has been shown to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake in the brains of rats resulting in increased\nnorepinephrine concentrations. In preclinical models, the analgesic activity due to the mu-opioid\nreceptor agonist activity of tapentadol can be antagonized by selective mu-opioid antagonists (e.g.,\nnaloxone), whereas the norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is sensitive to norepinephrine modulators.\nTapentadol exerts its analgesic effects without a pharmacologically active metabolite.\nEffects on the cardiovascular system: There was no effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of\ntapentadol on the QT interval. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled\ncrossover study, healthy subjects were administered five consecutive doses of NUCYNTA™ 100 mg\nevery 6 hours, NUCYNTA™ 150 mg every 6 hours, placebo and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin.\nSimilarly, NUCYNTA™ had no relevant effect on other ECG parameters (heart rate, PR interval, QRS\nduration, T-wave or U-wave morphology).\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nMean absolute bioavailability after single-dose administration (fasting) is approximately 32% due to\n14\n23\n®","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":14,"topic":"NUCYNTA Medication Information"}}

In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA™ may increase airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. Alternative non-mu-opioid agonist analgesics should be considered and NUCYNTA™ should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients.","reference_context":"Document 6: which may result in adverse cardiovascular events \n[see \nDrug Interactions (7.4)\n]\n.\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n5.1 Respiratory Depression\nRespiratory depression is the primary risk of mu-opioid agonists. Respiratory depression occurs more\nfrequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by\nhypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction, in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may\nsignificantly decrease pulmonary ventilation.\nNUCYNTA™ should be administered with caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia,\nhypercapnia or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nor cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, central nervous\nsystem (CNS) depression, or coma. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA™ may\nincrease airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. Alternative non-mu-\nopioid agonist analgesics should be considered and NUCYNTA™ should be employed only under\ncareful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. If respiratory depression\noccurs, it should be treated as any mu-opioid agonist-induced respiratory depression \n[see \nOverdosage\n(10.2)\n]\n.\n5.2 CNS Depression\nPatients receiving other mu-opioid agonist analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other\ntranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with\nNUCYNTA™ may exhibit additive CNS depression. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory\ndepression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death may result if these drugs are taken in\ncombination with NUCYNTA™. When such combined therapy is contemplated, a dose reduction of one\nor both agents should be considered.\n5.3 Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure\nOpioid analgesics can raise cerebrospinal fluid pressure as a result of respiratory depression with\ncarbon dioxide retention. Therefore, NUCYNTA™ should not be used in patients who may be\nsusceptible to the effects of raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure such as those with evidence of head\ninjury and increased intracranial pressure. Opioid analgesics may obscure the clinical course of patients\nwith head injury due to effects on pupillary response and consciousness. NUCYNTA™ should be used\nwith caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or other sources of preexisting increased\nintracranial pressure.\n5.4 Misuse and Abuse\nTapentadol is a mu-opioid agonist and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by\ndrug abusers and people with addiction disorders. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to\ncriminal penalty.\nNUCYNTA™ can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should\nbe considered when prescribing or dispensing NUCYNTA™ in situations where the physician or\npharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse and abuse. Concerns about abuse and\naddiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. However, all patients treated with mu-\nopioid agonists require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of mu-opioid\nagonist analgesic products carry the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use \n[see \nDrug\nAbuse and Dependence (9.2)\n]\n.\nNUCYNTA™ may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the product. These practices\npose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death \n[see \nDrug Abuse and\nDependence (9)\n]\n.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":6,"topic":"NUCYNTA Medication Information"}}

Patients should be\nadvised not to adjust the dose of NUCYNTA™ without consulting their physician \n[see \nDosage and\nAdministration (2)\n]. \nPatients should be advised that it may be appropriate to taper dosing when\ndiscontinuing treatment with NUCYNTA™ as withdrawal symptoms may occur \n[see \nDrug Abuse and\nDependence (9.3)\n]\n. The physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation\nof the medication.\n17.2 Misuse and Abuse\nPatients should be advised that NUCYNTA™ is a potential drug of abuse. Patients should protect\nNUCYNTA™ from theft, and NUCYNTA™ should never be given to anyone other than the individual\nfor whom NUCYNTA™ was prescribed \n[see \nWarnings and Precautions (5.4)\n].\n17.3 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\nAs NUCYNTA™ has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be\ncautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles \n[see \nWarnings and Precautions\n(5.5)\n]\n.\n17.4 Pregnancy\nPatients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become\npregnant during treatment with NUCYNTA™ \n[see \nUse in Specific Populations (8.1)\n].\n17.5 Nursing","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":19,"topic":"NUCYNTA Medication Information"}}

In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may\ndepend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with\noliguria and\/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and\/or death.\nIn hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in\nblood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually\nreversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and\/or diuretic therapy.

Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g.,\nspironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or\npotassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum\npotassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated, because of\ndemonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent\nmonitoring of serum potassium.\nLithium:\n Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly\nwith drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity\nwas usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor.
