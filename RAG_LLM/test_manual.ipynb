The chemical name for bisoprolol fumarate is (±)-1-[4-[[2-\\n(1-Methylethoxy)ethoxy]methyl]phenoxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-propanol (E)-2-\\nbutenedioate (2:1) (salt). It possesses an asymmetric carbon atom in its structure and is\\nprovided as a racemic mixture. The S(-) enantiomer is responsible for most of the beta-\\nblocking activity. Its molecular formula is (C\\nH\\nNO\\n)\\n•C\\nH\\nO\\n and its structure is:\\nBisoprolol fumarate has a molecular weight of 766.97. It is a white crystalline powder\\nwhich is approximately equally hydrophilic and lipophilic, and is readily soluble in water,\\nmethanol, ethanol, and chloroform.\\nBISOPROLOL FUMARATE TABLETS USP are available as 5 and 10 mg tablets for oral\\nadministration.\\nInactive ingredients include Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch (Pregelatinized),\\nCrospovidone, Dibasic Calcium Phosphate, Hypromellose, Magnesium Stearate,\\nMicrocrystalline Cellulose, Polyethylene Glycol, Polysorbate 80 and Titanium Dioxide. The\\n5 mg tablets also contain Red and Yellow Iron Oxide.\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\\nBISOPROLOL FUMARATE is a beta\\n-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking\\nagent without significant membrane stabilizing activity or intrinsic sympathomimetic\\nactivity in its therapeutic dosage range. Cardioselectivity is not absolute, however, and at\\nhigher doses (≥ 20 mg) bisoprolol fumarate also inhibits beta\\n-adrenoceptors, chiefly\\nlocated in the bronchial and vascular musculature; to retain selectivity it is therefore\\n1\\n18\\n31\\n4\\n2\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n1\\n2'"
